## 🎮 Gesture Overview

| Gesture               | Action                |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Open left hand        | Display numbers 1–5   |
| Open right hand       | Display numbers 6–10  |
| Thumb + ring finger   | Toggle volume control |
| Thumb + middle finger | Toggle skeleton view  |
| Finger distance       | Adjust system volume  |

## 💡 Key Learnings

1: Gesture systems depend heavily on logic design and UX

2: Thumbs require special handling due to biomechanics see

3: Stable UI anchors improve perceived accuracy

4: Preventing accidental triggers is critical for usability

## 📌 Future Improvements

1: Gesture stabilization (anti-flicker)

2: Smooth UI animations

3: Additional gesture-based controls

4: Platform-independent audio support

5: Gesture-based shortcuts or calculator mode
